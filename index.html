  <p> <font color="red"> La Tomatina Festival started the last Wednesday of August in 1945 when some young people spent time in the town square to attend the Giants and Big-Heads figures parade. The young people decided to take part in a parade with musicians, Giants and Big-Heads figures. One participant's Big-head fell off, as a result of the festivities. The participant flew into a fit of rage, and began hitting everything in their path. There was a market stall of vegetables that fell victim to the fury of the crowd, as people started to pelt each other with tomatoes until the local forces ended the fruit battle.

The following year, some young people engaged in a pre-planned quarrel and brought their own tomatoes from home. Although the local forces broke it up, this began the yearly tradition. In the following years, the boys' example was followed by thousands of people.

La Tomatina was banned in the early 1950s by Francisco Franco due to the festival's lack of religious importance, however, this did not stop the participants, who were arrested. The people protested the prohibition and the festival was again allowed with more participants. The festivity was again canceled until 1957 when, as a sign of protest, a tomato burial was held. It was a demonstration in which the residents carried a coffin with a huge tomato inside. The parade was accompanied by a music band that played funeral marches. The protest was successful, and La Tomatina Festival was finally permitted and became an official festival.[1]

As a result of the report of Javier Basilio, a broadcaster from the Spanish television program called Informe Semanal, the festival started to be known throughout the rest of Spain. Since then, the number of participants increased year after year as well as the excitement about La Tomatina Festival. In 2002, La Tomatina of BuÃ±ol was declared a Festivity of International Tourist Interest by the Secretary Department of Tourism due to its popularity. </font> </p>

  <p> <font color="orange"> Usually, the fight lasts for about one hour, after which the town square is covered with tomato debris.[5] Fire trucks then hose down the streets and participants often use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomatoes from their bodies. Some participants go to the Los PeÃ±ones pool to wash. The citric acid in the tomatoes leads to the washed surfaces in the town becoming very clean.[6][7]

Since 2013 participation in the event has been restricted to the holders of paid tickets. In 2015, it was estimated that almost 145,000 kg (320,000 lb) of tomatoes were thrown.[6]

The city council follows a short list of instructions for the safety of the participants and the festival:[8]

1. Do not throw anything but tomatoes
2. Do not tear clothes
3. Squash tomatoes before throwing them to avoid hurting others
4. Keep a safe distance from trucks
5. Stop throwing tomatoes after the second starter pistol shot
6. Follow the directions of security staff
7. Only throw tomatoes to a target you can see, to avoid hurting others 
8. Do not throw tomatoes directly at buildings
Have a great, fun time! </font> </p>
